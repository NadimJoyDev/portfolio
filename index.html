                I started learning the program only 1'5 year's ago. Before that I had a great interest in the program. After much thought, I took up the subject of programming. I have taken the basic concept of Html, Html-5, Css, Css3, Bootstrap, Python, c#, c++, Dart, Flutter & JavaScript. So far I have worked on 30+ projects. Notable among them are HOT-GADETS, PANDA, Birthday-Wish, MY_PROJECT, www.sabbirIT.com, Happy New Year Etc.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
